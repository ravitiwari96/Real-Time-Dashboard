# Real-Time Data Dashboard

This project is a real-time, dynamic data dashboard designed to display continuously updated information from a database. Using Python, Flask, SQL Server, and Power BI, this dashboard provides immediate insights into live data.

- **Data Pipeline:** Built a real-time data pipeline with Python and Flask to generate dynamic data.

- **API Integration:** Developed an API using Flask to automate data generation, feeding it directly into an SQL Server database.

- **Database Storage:** Leveraged SQL Server for structured storage and efficient querying of real-time data.

- **Direct Query in Power BI:** Connected Power BI to the SQL Server database via Direct Query, allowing live data updates on the dashboard.

- **Interactive Dashboard:** Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize real-time data with immediate refresh capabilities.
